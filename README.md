This webpage application accepts a series of inputs and determines the WSJF value of
jobs. It will then compare the value and time duration of the jobs to the
other jobs inputted and graph them to compare them and help visualise which
job should be completed first.

The theory of WSJF is outlined here: https://www.solutionsiq.com/resource/blog-post/visualizing-wsjf/
